## Moving Sport Player Segmentation
(C/ C++ / OpenCV ) â€“ Final poster competition third place
* A graph-based approach for detecting and segmenting the tennis player in temporal sequence of images. 
* Computer vision techniques included: [Gaussian Mixed Model] (http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/db/d5c/tutorial_py_bg_subtraction.html#gsc.tab=0), [Hough Transform] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform), [Mophorlogy] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_morphology), [region-growing filters] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_growing), etc. 
* Experimented result from several sequence images of tennis matches indicates that the proposed approach is able to segment the player reasonably well even under slight change of camera direction and various illuminations.
